This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

            Here are the commands in Escape the Museum:

            - go + (forward, backward, left, right)
            - take + (sword, rope)
            - steal + (scroll, key, necklace)
            - inventory
            - drop + (necklace, scroll, sword, rope)
            - exit
            - fight
            - talk
            - freak out
            - chat
            - help


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
    - Map
        You must not go too far or you'll fall off the map and start back at the door!
    - Trap
        One of the challenges you must overcome are the Trap spaces. The design of the game is made that you memorize how to get from the door to the exit, or other places. You must remember where the trap spaces are or else you will keep falling back to the start.
    - Weapons
        In the map there is a sword and a rope you can collect during your journey. A rope, although lethal, has a lower chance at beating a charcter when in battle. A sword is more powerful and gives you a better chance at beating any Characters.

    - Knight
        It is not required to win the game, but if you find the Knight you can interact with it and likely fight it. The better your weapon is, the better chance you have at beating them!
    - Painting 
        It is also not required to win the game, but you can fight the painting with a rope and there is a random chance that you could win. Again, the better the weapon, the better chance you have at beating the Painting.
    - Key 
        You MUST find a key in order to escape the museum. If you find the exit before you find the key, you cannot Exit successfully.
